##Keys
This markdown contains the script for loading the yelp API key, and the google places key for use in the dssg 2018 OSR project. 

###Load yelp client id & secret key
Created a new DSSG-OSR-2018 "app", need this info to query from yelp. Note that the previous yelp API required the use of a token, which appears in many existing yelp packeges, but this is no longer needed. 
```{r}
yelp_id <-"l2n6agEPQdzbXezfukLc-A"
yelp_api_key <- "ksY_KLOxa9iP_oAH7ISG65IxGxd7av_b7zK3GBZ1zLJ3wHKhoBnNLqp31_b7eKUBmCLJZ4-VPKljaMW2B5rlcxRrMjEwArFfiabPwBVjp3cvoVMmlbE2cdHV-OozW3Yx"
```

###Google Places API Key
```{r}
###Google Places API Key
places_key <- "AIzaSyBBFwzmJVkSxiwctOG6UYZGeGjbZJ_IH_4" #shhhh don't tell anyone 
```
