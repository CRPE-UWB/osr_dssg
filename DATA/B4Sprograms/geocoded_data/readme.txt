additional_program_level_geocode = geocoded additional session day level files

complete_geocoded_sessions = geocoded session day level file

program_level_geocode = geocoded program level file

combined_programs = *very* *important* combined program level geocoded file, that is, including the 9 unique 
		  programs (not sessions days), from the additional session day level files. Get's confusing,
		BUT- this is the complete program level dataset per use in the access index at least.
